# eslint-plugin-icon-button

Checker for accessibility of icon-button in JSX.

# Why?

It's sometimes easy to run an audit of your application to find all accessibility issues and fix them. The challenge then is maintaining this level of quality in the code without regularly telling developers that they should keep accessibility in mind. A common pattern when designing interfaces is to have buttons contain only icons (hence, "icon-button"). This hurts accessibility because screen reader technologies are not able to fathom its meaning. The solution then is to add an `aria-label` on the button to give context to a screen reader user.
